## Sum of First N Natural Numbers

Write a program that takes an integer N and calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using a loop.

## Factorial Calculation

Write a program that takes an integer N and calculates its factorial using a loop.

## Fibonacci Sequence

Write a program that prints the first N numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a loop.

## Multiplication Table

Write a program that takes an integer N and prints the multiplication table for that number up to N x 10 using a loop.

## Reverse a String

Write a program that takes a string and reverses it using a loop.

## Check Prime Number

Write a program that takes an integer N and checks if it is a prime number using a loop.

## Find the Largest Element in an Array

Write a program that takes an array of integers and finds the largest element using a loop.

## Sum of Elements in an Array

Write a program that takes an array of integers and calculates the sum of its elements using a loop.

## Count Vowels in a String

Write a program that takes a string and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it using a loop.

## Print a Pattern

Write a program that prints the following pattern using nested loops:

## Palindrome Check

Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward). Use a loop to compare characters.

## Find the Missing Number

Given an array of consecutive integers except for one missing number, find the missing number using a loop and mathematical calculations.

## Armstrong Number Check: An Armstrong number is an integer where the sum of the nth power of its digits is equal to the original number (e.g., 153). Write a program to check if a number is an Armstrong number using a loop.

## Linear Search:

Implement a linear search algorithm that takes an array and a target value, searching for the target's index within the array using a loop.

## Binary Search:

Implement a binary search algorithm for a sorted array. This efficient search repeatedly halves the search space based on comparison with the target value.

## String Rotation:

Write a program that checks if two strings are rotations of each other (e.g., "apple" and "leapp"). Use loops and string manipulation techniques.

## Find the Second Largest Element:

Modify the exercise to find the second largest element in an array, considering cases where the largest element might appear multiple times.

## Remove Duplicates from Array:

Write a program to remove duplicate elements from a sorted array. Use a loop and conditional statements to keep track of unique elements.

## Find the Leader in an Array:

An element is a leader if it is greater than all elements to its right. Write a program to find leaders in an array using a loop with a reverse traversal approach.

## Tower of Hanoi:

Implement the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion. This classic puzzle involves moving disks between three rods following specific rules.
